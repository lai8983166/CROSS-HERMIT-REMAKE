## Purpose

Extend the playable fourth-week school slice into the fifth-week workroom and school planning while preserving earned growth and saved progress. Keep source evidence, remake interaction, and the unimplemented next settlement boundary explicit.

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Source verified fifth week school entry
The system SHALL verify workroom, CH002, school dispatch and school data initialization on the same original CPU that completed the current fourth-week course and fifth-week Chapter018. It MUST retain explicit input, presentation and scheduler boundaries and MUST NOT substitute another campaign's snapshots.

#### Scenario: Actual fifth week continuation
- **WHEN** native Chapter018 produces pending state8 on 4/5
- **THEN** continuation consumes that request once and records workroom control, CH002 and school initialization with before/after data and source hashes

#### Scenario: Waiting prevents later stages
- **WHEN** the workroom continue input or CH002 readiness is unavailable
- **THEN** school preparation does not execute and earned records remain intact

### Requirement: Durable workroom and school planning
The system SHALL allow entering the workroom and then fifth-week school once, retaining current member growth, relationships, equipment, MVP and fourth-week review. Fifth-week members and courses SHALL be editable using verified movement and current course availability. Second settlement MUST remain unavailable in this change.

#### Scenario: Enter and edit new week
- **WHEN** the player enters school after the fifth-week workroom
- **THEN** the calendar shows 4/5, current members and attributes carry forward, and class movements and available course selections update only the fifth-week plan

#### Scenario: Repeat or invalid commands
- **WHEN** an entry command repeats or a command is premature, malformed or chooses an unavailable course
- **THEN** it is idempotent or refused atomically without granting growth, advancing the date or changing the saved command history

### Requirement: Compatible atomic saves
The system SHALL preserve v1/v2/v3 save loading with their original fingerprints and state verification, and save workroom and fifth-week plans in a new version with strict command replay. Failed load or write MUST preserve current memory and the existing recoverable saves.

#### Scenario: Old fifth week progress migrates
- **WHEN** a genuine v3 partial Chapter018 or completed exit save is loaded
- **THEN** its exact progress and earned records restore before any new workroom or school command runs

#### Scenario: Restore edited school plan
- **WHEN** the player saves in the workroom or after fifth-week class/course edits and relaunches
- **THEN** the correct screen and exact plan restore, without replaying the fourth-week reward into the fifth-week records

### Requirement: Graphical workroom navigation
The system SHALL show a source-derived workroom background and clear actions to enter school, review the prior course, save or preview battle. The fifth-week school SHALL show usable member/course controls and communicate the next settlement boundary. Restart and skip confirmations and battle return SHALL retain their existing behavior.

#### Scenario: Use workroom controls
- **WHEN** the player finishes fifth-week dialogue and chooses to enter the workroom
- **THEN** source-derived workroom art and entry controls appear, and entering school opens fifth-week planning

#### Scenario: Battle round trip and review
- **WHEN** the player reviews fourth-week results or enters and returns from battle during the new continuation
- **THEN** the fifth-week location and plan remain available and no date, reward or class edits are lost
